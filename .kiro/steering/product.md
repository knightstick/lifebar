# Product Overview

## Recurring Task Manager

A single-user web application for managing recurring tasks with visual "needs bar" indicators that degrade over time, similar to The Sims game mechanics.

### Core Features
- Create recurring tasks with custom intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, custom days)
- Visual status bars that transition from green (recently completed) to red (overdue)
- Mark tasks as complete to reset status bars
- Edit and delete existing tasks
- Dashboard view showing all tasks with current status

### Key Characteristics
- **Single-user application** - no authentication or multi-user support in initial version
- **Gamified approach** - visual feedback similar to The Sims needs bars
- **Time-based degradation** - status bars change color based on time elapsed since last completion
- **Simple and focused** - clean interface prioritizing quick task management

### Future Considerations (Icebox)
- Multi-user support (families, roommates)
- Task categories and notifications
- Real-time updates and gamification elements
- Points, streaks, and achievements
